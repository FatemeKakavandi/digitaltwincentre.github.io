## Pre-meeting stakeholders' reports

<!-- Please keep in mind that the minutes are publicly available.-->

#### Peter Gorm Larsen
* Had kick-off meeting with the board of the new Ringkj√∏bing Skjern project (and have interviewed 2 candidates for the new lab manager)
* Presentation about digital twins for a MADE workshop
* Produced video with Ole Green about their use of model-based stuff and prospects with digital twins (will probably be released this week)
* Discussed a new proposal to be submitted for the Danish Innovation Foundation August 2021 where we will lead a WP on digital twins
* Led the webinar on the 25th of November 2020 with different research presentations (also about digital twins) and booked slot for the next webinar for the 23 of February 2021 (if you wish to speak there please let us know)
* Attended a follow group about digital twins with the Dansh GTSs and a few companies

#### Nick Battle
* Work on Luhn and Basket Service models for CT training
* Presented VDMCheck to INTO-CPS Webinar
* Some LSP fixes for VDM-RT
* Create a VDMJ ValueVisitor to allow Leo to create an @Limit annotation
* Implemented LSP "translate" method to produce LaTeX output for a spec
* Response to VDMCheck feedback from Verified GmbH.
* Created VDMJ example for tree mapping.

#### Claudio Gomes
* Worked on the scenario verifier tool (algebraic loops and step finding loops done), with Simon
* Met with Prasad over definitions of models, solvers, simulators, FMUs, and machine learned models (with Christian and Prasad)
* Met with Novo with Fateme to clarify data Novo sent us and logistics for Fateme.

#### Jim Woodcock
* Started work on preparing six guest lectures for the BSc Programming & Modelling course. The lectures are on an Introduction to Probabilistic Robotics, to be delivered late April/early May.
* I'm proposing to start work on reasoning about cosimulation in Isabelle, building on Frank Zeyda's work (see Frank Zeyda, Julien Ouy, Simon Foster, Ana Cavalcanti: Formalising Cosimulation Models. SEFM Workshops 2017: 453-468). I'd welcome comments on this approach.

#### Daniella Tola
* Went through the different robot-related components Technicon supplies.
* Listed the main attributes I believe are relevant for describing a robotic arm, with regards to integration, e.g. (reachability, payload, weight, precision, footprint, mounting, communication protocols, manufacturer). 
* Started describing the "constraints" of the relationship of the robot and its attributes, e.g. it only has one manufacturer (m \in M), but can support multiple protocols ({c1,c2} \subseteq C).
* Found some nice robot simulation tools, e.g. RoboDK, Webots (open source). If anyone knows other good tools, please tell me.
* Presented at overture workshop.
   
#### Hao Feng
* Went through Least Square, Recursive Least Square, Kalman Filter.
* Wrote down the section of Kalman Filter for a tutorial paper. 
* Built a rabbitmq python class for further use.
* Ran a co-simulation of the incubator. 
   
#### Prasad Talasila
* Participation in the System Architecture and Design (SAD) meetings of DIGITbrain project. We have been able to refine the architecture and design of the DIGITbrain software.
* Created a presentation on different models used in the context of simulation, co-simulation and machine learning domains. The presentation have been used in WP5: Models of DIGITbrain project to agree on models and their meta-data for the DIGITbrain project.
* Participation in WP5: Models and WP6: Algorithms meetings of DIGITbrain project.
* DIGITbrain orientation program for Michael Sandberg. He is the new addition to our research group and will be participating in the DIGITbrain project.
* Preparation for the upcoming DIGITbrain general assembly. The meeting is scheduled for 10 to 11 December, 2020.
* Contribution to WP3 discussion of HUBCAP project to create and refine new requirements for next version of the HUBCAP Sandbox system.
* Participation in Overture workshop. Tomas Kulik presented our paper on Sandbox security model.
* Wrote parts of HUBCAP Sandbox performance paper.
   
#### HDM
* Gave a talk on the webinar about the into-cps application
* Participated in the yearly meeting on the Danish Water Cluster
* Provided two alternatives for fault-injection using Maestro V2 related to discussions with Gita
* Lectured on Overture Java Code Generation
* Stepped up as the AU representative in the OCMB of HUBCAP and have been busy on the different tasks associated with it

#### Emil Madsen
* AU DTL-Skjern:
  * Proposed production equipment, waiting for response from industrial partners.
* Robot model calibration:
  * Obtained and validated linear system.
  * Making linear least squares calibration case study with real data
  
#### Casper Thule
* Did a talk for kansas cooperation with SLANG
* Talk for webinar
* Creating external tester tool for maestro2 to root out ssues
* Finalising the isola 2020 paper on chrono fmu - had meeting with Frederik



## Sub-projects status

* FMI - Utilities website https://sweng.au.dk/fmiutils/ for showcasing some of our tools. Should it be maintained? Who should do it? Is it a priority? 

#### Sub-project X

#### Sub-project Y

#### Sub-project Z

##  Any Other Business
