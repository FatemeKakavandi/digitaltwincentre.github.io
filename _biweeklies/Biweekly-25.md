* DT for water case
   * I have been at a Danish Water Cluster workshop last week https://dendanskevandklynge.dk/ There were participants from several Danish Companies in the water       domain. It was unanimous that there is a need for Digitalization in water, but there are many unknowns. Workshop was made virtual due to covid... 
   * I was invited by WATEC to meet with AVK https://www.avkventiler.dk/ next week
* INTO-CPS Application
   * Regarding INTO-CPS, we sorted a bug in the into-cps application last week. We have been having troubles making DSE run in Kristoffer's machine. He is now able to run the DSE, but we found that Tutorial7.zip from the INTO-CPS Association SVN was the cause of the issue... Something wrong with it. Maybe problems in the filenames capitalizations...
   * We plan to finish the DSE improvement sprint soon and move towards upgrading the Electron version to the latest, and start improving the testing.
