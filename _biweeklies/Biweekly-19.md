<!-- Please keep in mind that the minutes are publicly available.-->

#### Peter Gorm Larsen
* Working on different papers for the ditital twin track of Isola 2020
* Progressed the different MADE FAST part projects involvement of digital twins
* Gave up on the digital twin plan with Terma for now
* Supplied digital twin feedback for a Danish paper on digital twins (see https://ipaper.ipapercms.dk/TekniskLandsforbund/teknikeren-2020/teknikeren-032020/?page=18#/)

#### Jim Woodcock

* Misc FMI-standard tasks. 

#### Nick Battle
* Made some progress with the FMI3 API model, as well as some updates to the static semantics as the FMI Standard is being changed.
* Fixed conditional breakpoints, hit counts and tracepoints in the LSP server, so you can now stop conditionally, stop when the break hitcount is =, >, >= or a multiple of some number, and "trace evaluate" expressions as the tracepoints are reached, without stopping.
* Raised some problems with the (new) Reference FMUs defined in the FMI Standard repository, both for FMI2 and FMI3.
* Made a couple of Overture fixes, following from bugs raised by Fuyuki Ishikawa.
* Had a quick look at some Maestro user documentation.
