## Pre-meeting stakeholders' reports

<!-- Please keep in mind that the minutes are publicly available.-->

#### Peter Gorm Larsen
* Starting up new PhD student called Tom Helyer at UNEW to look into verification of MBD CPSs this week
* Still working on getting the Danish part of the UPSIM ITEA3 project started up
* Expect to send out agenda for November 25 INTO-CPS Association/digital twins webinar next weekend (also to be distributed to members of MADE FAST, DIGITbrain, UPSIM and other projects that are attended by other members of the board of the INTO-CPS Association)
* Expect to hear from Danish green technology research applications next week

#### Nick Battle
* Continue POG LSP work for VSCode with Jonas and Frederik - PO display now seems to be working.
* Large restructure completed in LSP internals to anticipate Combinatorial Testing and Coverage Reporting
* Attempted to add multi-folder workspace support (still under test)
* Some Overture bug fixes and investigation, prompted by Leo.
* Started review of papers for Overture Workshop.
* Started discussions about the design of the CT testing feature.

#### Casper Thule
* Maestro2 has been released!
* Setting feature plan for Maestro2 development. 
* Formal approach to proving that a given specification adheres to i.e. a gauss-seidel/jacobi simulation algorithm with UPPAAL
* Released offical version of FMI-VDM - hope that is okay nick?! Needed it for maestro2 release

#### Claudio Gomes
* Got good preliminary results for a master algorithm that changes order of FMU stepping during the co-simulation
* Close to formalization of synchronous clocks for the FMI standard 3.0
* Working on machine learning survey (focusing on optimal experimental design and active learning).
* Helped Emil finish the linearization of the UR robot equations (Emil also checked that the symbolic procedure is correct).
  * This will make online monitoring algorithms work much faster (if we use a recursive LSE scheme).
  
#### Hao Feng
* Still in the process of modifying the technical report about the Incubator

#### Mirgita Frasheri
* Can send data from the rabbitmq fmu to a ROS/Gazebo simulation.
* Looking into the timing and synchronization issues when coupling the co-simulation with external simulators like Gazebo.
* Working on a manuscript for a paper on autonomy levels in the agriculture domain.

#### Prasad Talasila
* Write DIGITbrain experiment for AgroIntelli in collaboration with Xuping, ULBS and Alea Scovill. This experiment uses INTO-CPS toolchain.
* Working on the API documentation for Maestro2.

#### Maurizio Palmieri
* Working on the UPPAAL model for Master algorithm and FMUs with Simon.

#### Emil Madsen
* Working on minimal robot dynamics description
* Working for PUMA 560 robot but need implementation for Universal Robot manipulators
* Going to visit AAU and SDU in November (5th and 12th) to see their robotic and production equipment to get inspiration for own DKK 5-6 million purchase for Skjern/Ringk√∏bing project

#### Hugo Daniel Macedo
* Participated in Den Danske Vandklynge workshop about anInnovations data platform and a Data Ecosystem for Water.
* Will participate in a workshop next week on models for water balance.
* Working with Kristoffer to invoke Electron's javascript virtual machine to test the app functionality in a  non E2E setting.
* Made Overture website secure by serving the assets via HTTPS. Looking forward to work on the test report by Nick and release.
