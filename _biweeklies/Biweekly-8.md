## Pre-meeting stakeholder's reports

<!-- Please keep in mind that the minutes are publicly available, and that
private information must be stored elsewhere.  -->

#### HDM
* Is developing the Into-cps cloud app.
* Will focus on writing the extended version of the accompanying paper. 
* Waiting for details on the submission of an extended version for the accepted paper at co-sim workshop.

#### Nick
* Extended the dynamic semantic testing to include a combinatorial test suite for Model Exchange in addition to Cosimulation.
* Adding abstract function calls to the API functions to represent the "implementation" of the FMU, which will enable the semantic model to realise any particular FMU's behaviour - it's about half done so far.
* Updated the Overture workshop paper for Carl, to include updated results and a link to the online version of the checker.

#### Claudio
* Won't be able to attend the meeting.
* Working at CMU on an FMI exporter for ModelPlex.
* Going to meet with Stefan some time this week to discuss other research topics.

## Sub-projects status


#### Into-cps cloud app (HDM)
* Found some bugs in the COE assignment algorithm. 
* Improving backend testing.
* 50 user version in progress.

#### Maestro V2 DT enabled (CT)

#### Checker of FMUS (NB)
* Only a few changes to the static semantic model - most (transparent) changes to make the dynamic semantic modelling easier.
* Now that the dynamic sematics is close to "working", I want to move over to static semantic for FMI 3.0.

#### Tolerance Language (JW)

#### Graphical configuration inside App (CL)
