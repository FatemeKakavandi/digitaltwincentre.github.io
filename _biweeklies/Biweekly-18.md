## Pre-meeting stakeholder's reports

<!-- Please keep in mind that the minutes are publicly available.-->

#### Nick
* VDMCheck3 now checks up to three separate XML files from within an FMU, to account for the new FMI3 structures. Individual XML files of any type can also be checked.
* I'm working on the FMI3 VDM model using VS Code and the LSP server. This helps to flush out problems as well as highlighting which features are useful to add. Basic commands now added to the interface, which makes it more like Overture/VDMJ's command line.
* The FMI3 model itself is progressing, though there is still a dizzying amount of change still coming into the spec from the Community. The initialization of the four possible calls to fmi3InstantiateXXX are now complete, though testing continues.
