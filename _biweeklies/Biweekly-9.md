## Sub-projects status


#### Into-cps cloud app (HDM)
* Corrected the bugs found on backend COE's assignment.
* Launched a 5 COE version and performed first multi-user tests.
* Extennded Overture workshop paper about it was sent for reviews.

#### Maestro V2 DT enabled (CT)

#### Checker of FMUs (NB)
* VDMCheck renamed VDMCheck2 and created VDMCheck3 to work with the FMI3 model.
* Early draft of tool available, but there are very few FMI3 FMUs to check.
* The XSD schema has been changing wildly, so many example FMUs are non-compliant.
* FMI3 static semantics is even less clear than FMI2 because of lack of documentation, so will seek to clarify with community.

#### Tolerance Language (JW)

#### Graphical configuration inside App (CL)
