## Pre-meeting stakeholder's reports

<!-- Please keep in mind that the minutes are publicly available.-->

#### Peter Gorm Larsen
* Will meet with Poul Toft, PDF Foundation right after the biweekly meeting
* Started up a paper for Isola on the tolerance language as agreed last time

#### Nick Battle
* Went through Claudio's TLA+ model of FMI and read the first half of the Practical TLA+ book (personal copy arrived a couple of days ago). Will meet to discuss the way forward with model checking this afternoon (Monday).
* A lot of progress with Jonas and Frederik on the LSP server for VScode. The server itself is basically working well for VDM-SL, with just a few niggles. VDM++ multi-threaded debugging is more complex, as I imagined(!), but it also basically works. Unfortunately it's possible to lock up the debugger though, which I'm currently investigating. The extensions for basic language services are available, but not yet fully functional; there are no extensions yet for extra functionality, like PO generation and Combinatorial Testing. I'm not yet sure what VScode does with coverage. And we have to decide how to integrate the code generator from Overture (remember, LSP is currently based on VDMJ).

#### Claudio
* Work on fmi-standard doc (https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/pull/895)
* Prepare model checking video lecture.

#### Mustafa Din√ß
* I am testing INTO-CPS App 4.0.0 with tutorials (0,1,2, and 3 completed so far)

#### Stakeholder
