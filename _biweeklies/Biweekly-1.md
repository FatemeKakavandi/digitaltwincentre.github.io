Summary
---------------------

First meeting of the series. Every second week. Structure: Go around the table
and talk about status information. To optimize the meeting time, we should
share status beforehand in some platform, so we can read and advance, and
mainly discuss/ask questions during the meeting.

Jim presented himself as a researcher providing foundations for DT.

Hugo will provide admin. support and looking forward to new research collaborations.

Claudio asserted his role as co-simulation expert finishing his PhD in the area, looking forward to use it in the DT scenario.

Corneliu presented himself. Worked with an industrial digital twin at Vestas. PTC?? Before was at Siemens, and before at GE, interested in applications.

Carlos presented his background, and will be a future MSc on the topic.

PGL added that: 

- Energy Control will be used in classes by Corneliu. 
- Carlos will work on the manufacturing case for his MSc thesis next semester.
- Kenneth will work 1/3 of the time in this project.
- Nick started to do static checking of FMUs.

Regarding checking of FMUs and FMI based co-simulation there was interaction between Claudio and Jim about model based testing questions, and they will chat as a follow up. 

PGL: Suggested sending either Casper or Claudio to the FMI 3.0 committee meetings soon, so we are seen as collaborators by the community.

PGL: Expects this meetings to increase collaboration among partners.

Claudio and colleagues are starting a Digital Twin review and need man-hours for thatâ€¦

PGL: Suggests we follow up on this next meeting.

Plans for next weeks. PGL to set up SVN and Hugo is to add the minutes there.
