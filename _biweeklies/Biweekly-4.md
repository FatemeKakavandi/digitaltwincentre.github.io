#### Peter Gorm Larsen
* I have had a successful meeting with the Poul Due Jensen Foundation
* I have written a letter of support for the Simula Research Lab application on a Centre for Digital Twins with funding from the norwegian givernment. If it will be granted it can be beneficial for our centre as well
* I consider if the indoor positioning technology presented at http://www.gamesontrack.com/satellites.html could be beneficial for a new generation of the line following robot in a digital twin context. Input is very welcome
* I hope that we will be able to be involved in a proposal for an Innovation Action on digital twins coordinated by Fraunhofer in Germany
* I met with the Plant & Food Research organisation from New Zealand about potential research collaboration around agricultural digital twins. Too early to say if this will lead anywhere
* On Monday the 23rd of September we will have a WebEx with Siemens where they will demonstrate their simulation capabilities including Amesim.
* Currently targeting a one-day Mindsphere traing day in Aarhus in October for the manufacturing case study
* We are in the process of extending the current amnufacturing setup with an extension of the MIR robor such that it can have a Universal Robot arm on top of it
