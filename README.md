# The Digital Twin Centre Website

This repository holds the source of the [digitaltwincentre.github.io](digitaltwincentre.github.io) website.  It uses the Jekyll-based GitHub Pages service to transform the pages into something more interesting than raw markdown-formatted text.

Editing may be done directly on the repository web interface, or it may be checked out as a git repository and manipulated locally.  (Anything but trivial changes are likely to need the latter approach.)

Please file bugs about the website in the [issues tracker for this repository](https://github.com/digitaltwincentre/overturetool.github.io/issues).
